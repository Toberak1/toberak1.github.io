<h3>Jekyll Themes</h3>
<p>Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your <a href="https://github.com/Toberak1/toberak1.github.io/settings/pages">repository settings</a>. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll <code>_config.yml</code> configuration file.</p>

<h2>How to <strong>post in Jekyll</strong></h2>
<p>You’ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>
<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>
<pre><code>YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code>MONTH</code> and <code>DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code>MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>
<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, #{name}"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span>
</code></pre></div>
